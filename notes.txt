TODO

Set up connection to API - no api required, but limited to 200 requests a minute, so it would probably be good to request an API key to use (though, I don't really want to put this on GitHub in case my key gets abused and it is linked to my name, so I'll probably go without it if I can)

functionality - view different assets and their prices 
- list view with summary detail of each - done (needs formatting)
- assets much be filterable or searchable (why not both?) - done

detail view of each asset - done needs formatting

ability to maintain a wallet - TODO
- add, remove asset amount
- remove fractional or whole amounts
- see value equated in USD as value changes over time (meaning, if I purchase bitcoin, then the price changes, I see the current quantity in USD)
- persist data between sessions (possible ngrx implementation, however, this might get complex to implement. Might be better to just try setting stuff in session storage for starts https://blog.briebug.com/blog/how-to-add-ngrx-store-slices-into-localstorage)

Views

Home - list view of assets - done needs formatting
